MachineLearningDemos: Some demos for maching learning.

### Basics
* Classifying with k-Nearest Neighbors
* Splitting datasets one feature at a time: decision trees
* Classifying with probability theory: naive Bayes
* Logisit regression
* Support vecor machines
* Improving classification with AdaBoost meta-algorithm

### Forecasting numeric values with regession
* Predicting numeric valuses: regression
* Tree-based regression

### Unsupervised learing
* Grouping unlabeled items using k-means clustering
* Association analysis with the Apriori algorithm
* Efficiently finding frequent itemsets with FP-growth

### Other
* Using pincipal component analysis to simplify data
* Simplifying data with singular value decomposition
* Big data and MapReduce
